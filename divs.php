		"Ballpark Picks" was originally supposed to be just for baseball, and it's name is a takeoff of "Ballpark Franks". Later on we decided to add football, basketball and hockey to the site, but the name stuck.
		<br>
		Yes, we realize that only baseball is played at a ballpark, while football is played at a stadium, and basketball and hockey are played at arenas.

		The BBP team is comprised of experienced software developers who happen to be huge sports fans too. This combination gives you the best possible analysis of all big league games.
		<br>
		Prior to each game, the cumulative data of both teams is analyzed, and each team is assigned a grade based on a complex algorithm that we've developed. After the computer decides which team is most likely to win the game, the final score is computed, and the pick is published to the site. We try to have the picks ready by each morning, and at the beginning of each NFL week.

	<p>
		Our win/loss accuracy is over 20% higher than the average accuracy of other sports predictions sites, therefore we feel that BallparkPicks.com is your home for knowing better who will win.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, using the site is absolutely free. There may be a time down the road where we may have to charge a small fee for our services.
